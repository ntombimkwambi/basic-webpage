    <img src="/home/coder/Documents/webpage/images/telephone-booth london.jpg" alt="">
      <p>The one city in the world that I would dearly love to visit is the city of London :-).
       It is said that the city of London has more than 300 languages that are being spoken in it.<br>
        Being the person that I am,
       a person who is interested on learning more about diversity I would love to go there to learn about the caltures and ask about  the languages being spoken there.<br>
       Besides the language diversity, London has got thee Eiffel tower. It has always been my dream that one day I will go and see it with my own eyes.<br>
       It is also said that in London there is a cereal bar which serves more than a 100 varietion of cerealfrom
       different parts of the world.

    <h2>French, my favourite foreign language</h2>

    <p>The foreign language that I would love to learn is French. I choose French becouse I have a lot of close
       friends that speaks French and I would love to  communicate with them in their language. I also love
       their accent and I enjoy listening to them talk. I would love to visit other African countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo and in there, they speak French.
